# Movie List App

## Description

The Movie List App is built using Reactjs, with the main goal of enhancing skills in React development. In the development process, I implemented the use of react-router, react-bootstrap, and integrated data from the "OMDb - The Open Movie Database" API. Additionally, the application also stores data in web storage.

## How to Use the App

1. **Open the Website Page**
   - Access the application's website page to start using it.

2. **Search for Desired Movies**
   - Use the search feature to find the desired film or movie.

3. **View Movie Details**
   - Click the detail button on the desired film to see more information.
   - A modal will appear, displaying comprehensive details about the movie.

4. **Save to My List**
   - On the movie detail modal, find the "Save to My List movies" button.
   - Press this button to save the movie to your personal list.

5. **View My List**
   - To view the list of saved movies, navigate to the "My List movies" page in the navigation bar.

## Important Notes

1. This application is still in development and may have limitations.
   - I will continue to work on improving the quality and features of the application.
